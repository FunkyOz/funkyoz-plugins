## Quick Reference

### Critical Path (Minimum Viable Product)
To get a working MVP, complete these tasks in order:
1. **Phase 1** (Tasks 01-02): [Phase description]
2. **Phase 2** (Tasks 03-04): [Phase description]

**MVP Duration:** [estimate]

### Full Feature Set
For complete implementation with all features:
- All [total] tasks
- **Total Duration:** [estimate]

## Task Status Legend

- `todo` - Not started
- `progress` - Currently being worked on
- `done` - Completed and tested

---

## Complexity Ratings

- **Low** - Straightforward implementation, ~1-2 days
- **Medium** - Moderate complexity, ~3-5 days
- **High** - Complex implementation, ~1-2 weeks

---

## Priority Levels

- **Critical** - Must be done, blocks other work
- **High** - Important for core functionality
- **Medium** - Valuable but not blocking
- **Low** - Nice to have, can be deferred

---

## Notes

- Tasks should generally be completed in numerical order within each phase
- Some tasks can be parallelized if they don't have shared dependencies
- Testing should be done alongside implementation
- Update this index when task statuses change
